    I am pursuing a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence at MIT, focusing on reinforcement learning, robotics, and agent systems. I currently work at CSAIL and Harvard’s AI & Robotics Lab on improving hierarchical agentic goal decomposition, imitation learning, and safe agent deployment in both digital and physical environments. To continue my studies, I turned down my acceptance to Y Combinator’s Fall 2025 batch by David Lieb for an agentic ML project I worked on in high school. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Before MIT, I contributed to CNNs at Dr. Dena J. Clink’s lab at Cornell and helped improve OpenFace’s accuracy at Carnegie Mellon. I also developed early AI voice-agent systems, end-to-end neural network applications, full-stack platforms, and MLOps automation pipelines on my own, while gaining industry experience as a SWE intern at LexisNexis Risk Solutions through CodeDay Labs. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Some other things I did: 
  </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ranked <a href="/assets/pubgtop5.png" target="_blank">top 5</a> in North America for PUBG mobile in middle school</li>
    <li>Built <a href="https://www.dormsell.com/" target="_blank">Dormsell</a>, MIT's first web marketplace</li>
    <li>Started my high school's first ever <a href="https://engineeringbeavers.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">engineering club</a> and chemistry olympiad team</li>
    <li>Founded <a href="https://www.wesimplycode.org/" target="_blank">Simply Code</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit bringing hands-on technology education to 100+ students</li>
    <li>Wrote a first edition <a href="/assets/download/Foundations_And_Applications_of_AI_J.L.pdf" download>300+ page AI textbook</a> using AI in three hours to demonstrate AI's potential</li>
  </ul>
    <p>
    Motivated by my upbringing in a low-income immigrant family, I’m driven to build AI and robotics systems that are safe and widely accessible. Feel free to reach out, I’d love to learn more about your work and collaborate.
