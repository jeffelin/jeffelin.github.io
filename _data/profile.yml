  <p>
    I am pursuing a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Physics at MIT, spanning reinforcement learning, robotics, and nanotechnology. Currently, I am building agentic PBE systems through CSAIL and production ML models with Public Invention. In the past, I interned as a SWE at LexisNexis Risk Solutions through CodeDay Labs and was invited to be a technical PM at Coded by Kids.

  </p>

  <p>
  In high school, I conducted research in ML embedded systems at Carnegie Mellon University and annotated data in Dr. Dena J. Clink's lab at Cornell. Independently, I have worked on AI voice agents for automating manual data entries, neural networks for healthcare, MLOPs automation workflows, and numerous full stack applications, winning first at NY's Junior Academy of the Sciences with NEOM. 
  </p>
  <p>
     I've also been accepted to Next Chapter, Roote, and Y Combinator's Fall 2025 batch by David Lieb for an agentic ML project, which I turned down to attend MIT. Being apart of these business and startup communities has trained me to reason more from a consumer lens, and this has significantly increase the effectiveness of my technical projects. 

  </p>
  <p>
    Seeing the immense power technology with passion can bring, I co-founded Simply Code, a 501(c)(3) making technology more fun for 100+ students. Growing up from a low income background, I developed a strong work ethic, sense of responsibility, and humanity at an early age to create good tech. My contacts are below; I'd love to learn more about your story and potentially collaborate!
