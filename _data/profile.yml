  <p>
    I am pursuing a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Physics at MIT, spanning reinforcement learning, biotechnology, and robotics. Recently, I interned as a SWE at LexisNexis Risk Solutions through CodeDay Labs and was invited to be a technical PM at Coded by Kids.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the past, I researched embedded systems with ML at Carnegie Mellon University and assisted on data annotations for LLMs in Dr. Dena J. Clink's lab at Cornell. Independently, I built AI voice agents for automating manual data workflows, neural networks from scratch, and MLOPs automation workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also been accepted to YC's F25 batch by David Lieb, which I turned down for MIT, and helped found Simply Code, a nonprofit dedicated to making technology more fun for 100+ students. My contacts are below - I'd love to collaborate!
